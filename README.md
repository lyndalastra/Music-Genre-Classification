# Music-Genre-Classification

## Why this project: 	 	 		
- When looking for new songs on music streaming platforms, information overload can result in less satisfied, less confident, and more confused users.
- There are a variety of characteristics that allow us to distinguish between different genres, which makes music production very complex.
- It looked fun and I wanted to learn more about sound and signal processing. 
					

## Goals:		
- Identify music genres based on audio features so that audio streaming companies can place useful recommendations for customers and create a genre filter on their platforms.
- Make music composition easier. 

## Success metrics: 										
- Users spend less time and energy researching songs and feel happier. 		
- Music streaming platforms generate an increase in traffic as content users spread word of mouth.
- Music composers can produce music for the right target audience. 
	
## Data: 
- Source: marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html#	 	 			
- The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all in .wav format.
				
## Overall approach:
- Feature Engineering using Librosa, a library for audio analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and a lot of research on signal processing.
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and SVC).
- Data augmentation on the training set, which improved my scores.
- Development of a simple deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow.
